"""Verify that every line the yukawa customization commit adds is still
present, verbatim, in the working tree after the weekly GKI rebase re-applies
it onto a new upstream tip.

`git am` (even without --3way) can apply a patch "successfully" while a hunk
lands via fuzzy context matching, or effectively no-ops because upstream's
own version of a file changed in the same region. Neither case is reported
as a conflict, so a real regression (a dropped pinctrl reference, a deleted
device node, a flipped dr_mode, ...) can silently ship. This script re-checks
the applied result against the original diff's added lines and fails loudly
instead.

Usage: verify_rebase.py <diff-file>
Exits 1 and prints missing (file, line) pairs if anything the diff added is
no longer found in the corresponding file on disk.
